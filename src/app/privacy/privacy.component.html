      <b><i>Information We Collect</i></b><br>

          Information you submit as part of the registration process such as your name and email address
        </li>
        <li>
          Information you elect to submit (including, without limitation, any text, documents,
          images or other content or materials) to any areas of the Service that are accessible by
          other Service users within your organization ("User Submissions"). Such information may be
          shared with other Services users within your organization - as elected by you via the Service.
          For example, if you update your opportunity data or upload an image, that may be visible to other Service users within your organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information that Relatas may obtain from third-party services (both Personal and Enterprise
          Information, such as CRM data, files, email/calendar information, and contacts) that Relatas
          requires for the operation of the Relatas service.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Google Apps/Gmail users/ Outlook users, Relatas collects email and calendar metadata for
          the sole business-related use of the user and Relatas Client. Such information is never provided
          or disclosed to anyone other than the user and users specifically authorized by the Relatas.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may also provide us with your contacts email addresses when sharing files with them or if you invite them to join Relatas. In addition, if you sign up for our paid Service, you may be asked to provide additional information, including your credit card information.
        </li>

      </ul>

      You acknowledge and agree that you will not (i) provide us with any information that you do not have the right to provide, or (ii) share, via the Service, any information you do not have the right to share (such as information that is confidential to any third party and that you are not authorized to share with your intended recipients).

      <br>
      <br>
      Note that certain features of the Service may allow you to import information from third party services (such as Salesforce) ("Third Party Services"). By requesting that Relatas import such information, you authorize Relatas to use your Third Party Service username and password to access the applicable Third Party Service Account. This authentication process is managed by the applicable Third Party Service provider. Relatas will not use your Third Party Service account credentials for any other purpose.

      We may collect information about you directly from you, from third parties (such as your employer), from third party accounts that you connect through the Services, as well as automatically through your use of our Site or Services.<br><br>



      All interaction data is used to show you the interactions directly in Relatas and make sense of your interactions to respond directly from Relatas to help provide a seamless experience. The reason we request your permission to send mails, is to provide you with single unified insightful experience within Relatas without you hoping on to different screen just for sending mails. For example, Relatas would discover lost contacts and provide you with relevant content to rekindle the client-customer relationship. With a click of button, you can seamlessly send mails from Relatas instead of tabbing back to mails with the copied content.<br><br>

      <b><i>Cookies and Other Tracking</i></b><br>

      As mentioned above, we might use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. <br><br>



      <b><i>Do-Not-Track</i></b><br>
      Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Relatas does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Relatas takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies or opting out of ad networks).

      <br><br>



      <b><i>Cookies</i></b><br>  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We might use cookies to uniquely identify you, in order to help us to process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies some features of our Site may not function.<br><br>



      <b><i>Clear GIFs</i></b><br>  Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive. We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of Site visitors and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.<br><br>



      <b><i>Third-Party Analytics</i></b><br>   We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics to evaluate usage of our Sites and the services we provide; you can opt out of these tools as follows: Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics.  We use these tools to gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences.  These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Sites with other information that they have collected.  This Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data.<br><br>



      <b><i>Marketing Choices</i></b><br>

      We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you, as well as transactional emails (such as notifications and feedback requests). You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us. We may still send you mails regarding your meetings details, interaction reports. You may change the frequency of interaction reports under settings.<br><br>



      <b><i>Plug-ins and Social Media Widgets</i> </b><br>

      Our Site may include social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook Like button and the "Share this" button, as well as other interactive mini-programs that run on our Site and Services and enable certain features to work (e.g., blogs and comments). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for other purposes. These features are displayed on our Site, but are hosted by third parties, and are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. <br><br>



      <b><i>User-Generated Content</i></b><br>

      Portions of our Services, as well as surveys and other requests that we send to you via email or other method, may request or permit you to submit comments, feedback and other content; any information that you submit via one of these methods may be viewable to other visitors to our Site.
