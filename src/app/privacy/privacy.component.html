          other Service users within your organization ("User Submissions"). Such information may be
          shared with other Services users within your organization - as elected by you via the Service.
          For example, if you update your opportunity data or upload an image, that may be visible to other Service users within your organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information that Relatas may obtain from third-party services (both Personal and Enterprise
          Information, such as CRM data, files, email/calendar information, and contacts) that Relatas
          requires for the operation of the Relatas service.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Google Apps/Gmail users/ Outlook users, Relatas collects email and calendar metadata for
          the sole business-related use of the user and Relatas Client. Such information is never provided

        </li>
        <li>
          You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing files with them or if you invite them to join Relatas. In addition, if you sign up for our paid Service, you may be asked to provide additional information, including your credit card information.
        </li>

      </ul>

      You acknowledge and agree that you will not (i) provide us with any information that you do not have the right to provide, or (ii) share, via the Service, any information you do not have the right to share (such as information that is confidential to any third party and that you are not authorized to share with your intended recipients).

      <br>
      <br>
      Note that certain features of the Service may allow you to import information from third party services (such as Salesforce) ("Third Party Services"). By requesting that Relatas import such information, you authorize Relatas to use your Third Party Service username and password to access the applicable Third Party Service Account. This authentication process is managed by the applicable Third Party Service provider. Relatas will not use your Third Party Service account credentials for any other purpose.
      <br><br>
      We may collect information about you directly from you, from third parties (such as your employer), from third party accounts that you connect through the Services, as well as automatically through your use of our Site or Services.<br><br>



      <b><i>Google/ Office 365 Information We Collect</i></b><br>

      <li> Authentication - Your user authentication during Google/ Office365 login is used to authenticate you with your Google/ Office365 authentication.

      <li> User profile information - Your user profile information from Google/ Office365 is used to populate your data on Relatas e.g. your Name/ Designation/ Company, etc.

      <li> Calendar - with Calendar request access, Relatas shows you the interaction details of who you are going to meet and the relationship strength with that person along with the recent interaction and other insights

      <li> Email - with email request access, Relatas shows you all your email interactions and Relatas AI engine also shows you if you have recieved an important mail or a mail that you forgot to respond to, which you can reply directly from Relatas.

      <li> SMS / call (mobile app) - with SMS/ call access, Relatas understands who you are losing touch with and reminds you at the appropriate time to get in touch with them.<br> <br>



        All interaction data is used to show you the interactions directly in Relatas and make sense of your interactions to respond directly from Relatas to help provide a seamless experience. The reason we request your permission to send mails, is to provide you with single unified insightful experience within Relatas without you hoping on to different screen just for sending mails. For example, Relatas would discover lost contacts and provide you with relevant content to rekindle the client-customer relationship. With a click of button, you can seamlessly send mails from Relatas instead of tabbing back to mails with the copied content.<br><br>

        <b>Cookies and Other Tracking</b><br>

        As mentioned above, we might use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. <br><br>



        <b><i>Do-Not-Track</i></b><br>
        Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Relatas does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Relatas takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies or opting out of ad networks).

        <br><br>



        <b><i>Cookies</i></b><br>  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We might use cookies to uniquely identify you, in order to help us to process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies some features of our Site may not function.<br><br>



        <b><i>Clear GIFs</i></b><br>  Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive. We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of Site visitors and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.<br><br>



        <b><i>Third-Party Analytics</i></b><br>   We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics to evaluate usage of our Sites and the services we provide; you can opt out of these tools as follows: Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics.  We use these tools to gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences.  These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Sites with other information that they have collected.  This Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data.<br><br>
