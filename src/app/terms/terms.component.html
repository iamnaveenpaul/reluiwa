        Welcome to the Relatas, Inc. ("Us" or "Our" or "We")  Website ("Website") and Mobile Application ("Mobile Application")</h2>





      These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a legal contract between You and Us (collectively, "Everyone") and govern Your use of all the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs and more (all of which We refer to as "Materials") that We and Our affiliates may make available to You, as well as any services ("Services") We may provide through any of Our websites (all of which are referred to in these Terms as this "Website") or Mobile Application.<br><br>

        THIS MEANS THAT WE DO NOT PROMISE YOU THAT THE WEBSITE AND THE MOBILE APPLICATION ARE FREE OF PROBLEMS, CONTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION, WILL BE AVAILABLE TO YOU, OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, We make no warranty that the Website or the Mobile Application will meet Your requirements or that the Website or the Mobile Application will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free or that defects in the Website or the Mobile Application will be corrected. We make no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the Website or the Mobile Application or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Website or the Mobile Application. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by You through the Website or the Mobile Application or from Us or Our subsidiaries/other affiliated companies shall create any warranty.

        <b>LOCAL LAWS; EXPORT CONTROL</b><br>

        We control and operate the Website and the Mobile Application from Our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of the Website and the Mobile Application may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.  If You use the Website or the Mobile Application outside the United States of American, You are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.<br><br>



        <b>FEEDBACK</b><br>

        Any submissions by You to Us (e.g., comments, questions, suggestions, materials - collectively, "Feedback") through any communication whatsoever (e.g., call, fax, email) will be treated as both non-confidential and non-proprietary.  You hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and We are free to use, without any attribution or compensation to You, any ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in the Feedback, whether or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services using such Feedback.  You understand and agree that We are not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and You have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.<br><br>



        <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b><br>

        Please Read This Provision Carefully.  It Affects Your Legal Rights.<br><br>

        This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort - including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence - or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between You and Us.  Effectively, then, "dispute" is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.<br><br>

        This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of These Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  We prefer this because We believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.  To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney's fees).  You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION. <br><br>





        Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution<br><br>

        For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give Us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by emailing Us, at hello@relatas.com, the following information: (1)Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of Your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief You seek. If We do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving Your notification, then You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.  You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.<br><br>



        Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out<br><br>

        Notwithstanding the above, You or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Opt-Out Deadline").  You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at hello@relatas.com the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Us through arbitration. Either way, We will not take any decision You make personally.  In fact, We promise that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with Us.  But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.<br><br>



        Arbitration Procedures<br><br>

        If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings.  The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.<br><br>

        For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.  In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. <br><br>

        Because the Website, the Mobile Application and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.<br><br>



        Arbitration Award - The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.<br><br>



        Location of Arbitration - You or We may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, California or the federal judicial district that includes Your billing address.  In the event that You select the latter, We may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco, California so long as We agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines You incur as a result of the transfer.<br><br>



        Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs - So long as You place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, We will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, You will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys' fees or expert witnesses.  In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Us as provided in the section above titled "Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution" and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.<br><br>





        Class Action Waiver<br><br>

        Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.  If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You.  Neither You, nor any other user of the Website or the Mobile Application can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.<br><br>



        Jury Waiver<br><br>

        You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, You and We are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Provision, You and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.<br><br>



        Severability<br><br>

        If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.<br><br>



        Continuation<br><br>

        This Provision shall survive the termination of Your account with Us or Our affiliates and Your discontinued use of the Website and the Mobile Application.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, We agree that if We make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), You may reject any such change and require Us to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between Us arises.<br><br>



        <b>GENERAL</b><br><br>

        We think direct communication resolves most issues - if We feel that You are not complying with these Terms, We will tell You.  We will even provide You with recommended necessary corrective action(s) because We value this relationship.<br><br>

        However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Us, may require immediate termination of Your access to the Website and the Mobile Application without prior notice to You.  The Federal Arbitration Act, California state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.  Foreign laws do not apply.  Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Website or the Mobile Application will be heard in the courts located in Alameda County, California.  If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.  By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, We are not waiving Our rights.  These Terms are the entire agreement between You and Us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Everyone about the Website or the Mobile Application.  The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by You, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.<br><br>
